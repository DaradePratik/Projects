# World Happiness Report

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
What is happiness to you?

The member states of the United Nations, through its Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched in 2012, has begun the process of quantifying happiness in each country around the world, in an effort to collect information that will help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 21st Century. This process is known as The World Happiness Report, and a new report is scheduled to arrive every year for the foreseeable future.

To the United Nations, quantifying happiness involves measuring and aggregating 6 explanatory factors. The aggregate of these factors is known as the "Happiness Score". The 6 explanatory factors that the UN has agreed upon are:  
GDP per capital  
Social support  
Healthy life expectancy  
Freedom to make life choices  
Generosity  
Perception of corruption.  

The UN has chosen these factors because the most current research has shown that these 6 factors most accurately explain national-level differences in life evaluations. The 6 factors are not meant to be interpreted as specific causal agents, but rather to be understood as proven correlates to the happiness and well-being of a nation. They are seen as trusted metrics in the emerging science of happiness and well-being. (The 2019 World Happiness Report FAQ)
